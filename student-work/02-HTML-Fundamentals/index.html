        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are
        the languages of the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>
      <h3>What Is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that
        web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
        (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Opening tag</strong>: This is the first part of an HTML
          element. It's the name of the element wrapped in angle brackets. This
          tells the browser that an HTML element is coming up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closing tag</strong>: This is the second part of an HTML
          element. It's the same as the opening tag, except that it has a
          forward slash before the element name. This tells the browser that the
          HTML element has ended.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content</strong>: This is the content of the HTML element.
          This is the part that is displayed on the webpage.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>

      <h3>Why Learn HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
        web. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          Worpress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
